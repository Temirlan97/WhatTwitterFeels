  \section*{Abstract}
  
  Consider this a separate document, although it is submitted together
  with the rest. The abstract aims at another audience than the rest
  of the proposal. It is directed at the final decision maker or
  generalist, who typically is not an expert at all in your field, but
  more a manager kind of person. Thus, don't go into any technical
  description in the abstract, but use it to motivate the work and to
  highlight the importance of your project.

  \section{Introduction}

  This, like the rest, addresses fellow experts from your field (but
  not from your particular topic of research). Here you should
  technically connect to the main concepts from that field and give an
  outline of your project, stating the research/engineering question
  that you want to get answered by your project.

  (target size: 1 page)

  \section{Statement and Motivation of Research}

  This part should make clear which question, exactly, you are
  pursuing, and why your project is relevant/interesting. This is the
  place to cite relevant literature. Where does your project extend
  the state of the art? What weaknesses in known approaches do you
  hope to overcome? If you have carried out preliminary experiments,
  describe them here.

  (target size: 3-5 pages)

  \section{Description of the Investigation}

  This is the technical core of the thesis. Here you lay out your how
  you answered your research question, you specify your design of
  experiments or simulations, point out difficulties that you
  encountered, etc.

  (target size: 3-4 pages)

  \section{Evaluation of the Investigation}

  This section discusses criteria that are used to evaluate the
  research results. Make sure your results can be used to published
  research results, i.e., to the already known state-of-the-art.

  (target size: 1-3 page)

  \section{Conclusions}

  Summarize the main aspects and results of the research
  project. Provide an answer to the research questions stated earlier.

  (target size: 1/2 page)
